The purpose of this analysis was to show W.Avy the temperature trends in the city of Oahu. We provided W.Avy the temerature trends for the months of June and December in order to see if the Surf and Icecream business can be able to sustain throughout year round before opening the store. 

## Results
 1. From the temperature we found in the months of June and December, The lowest temperature it can get in the month of December is 56 while in June the lowest temperature it will get is 64. Both temperature is a little bit on the chilly side but still is manageable to run the store. Good news is the highest temperature it can get in December is 83 and in June the highest temperature it will get is 85. So we know from this result that there will hot days in Oahu where consumers will be intersted to buy ice cream. 
2. Based on the anlaysis is also safe to assume that through the months of June and December the average temperature reaches in the low 70s. This helps us show W.Avy that the Surf and Icecream shop can be able to stay open and be sustainable through the year.

## Summary
I believe that the Surf and Ice Cream shop would do well in the city of Oahu based off the data we extracted of the temperatures in the months of June and December.
We can always do more analysis to help decide. It will be interesting to get data on the wind and rain because that could affect the number of people that could be out surfing on a warm but windy day or even have peopl/tourist out on rainy days. It will also be beneficial to see the data of where potential competitors are at and how they are doing in sales. Plus also see data to find the distance and location of where to put the shop where majority of the people/tourists can see and walk-by.
